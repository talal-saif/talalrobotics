## About

I am an aspiring robotics software engineer actively building my foundation in modern C++ and real-time robotic systems.

While currently advancing through core C++ concepts, I am simultaneously developing a strong and structured GitHub presence to document my growth and reflect professional-level standards.

My technical environment is fully configured with ROS 2 (Humble), Gazebo, RViz, and colcon, optimized for robotics software development on Ubuntu Linux.

I am focused on mastering key areas in robotics software including:

- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Path Planning and Motion Control
- Robot Navigation and Autonomous Behavior
- Sensor Fusion and Embedded Systems
- Robotics Middleware and Control Architectures
- Realistic Simulations and Testing Environments

I am currently working on real-world robotics software projects with the intent to pursue advanced roles in the industry and research-driven environments.

This GitHub account reflects my professional journey and serves as the technical foundation for future internships, collaborations, and contributions to open-source robotics.
